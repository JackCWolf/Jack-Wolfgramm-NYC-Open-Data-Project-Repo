Jack Wolfgramm NYC Open Data Project
==============================

Thanks for checking out my first Springboard project! The idea of the project was to predict business success by analyzing the success of nearby businesses. In practice that means that I added features to a regression model (XGBoost) by using k-means. Despite the fancy file structure, the meat of the project can be found in the 'notebooks' section. You can also check out the final report in the 'report' section. I would be super happy to hear any feedback if you have the time!
